By [Pine](https://github.com/octref) & [Peng](https://github.com/rebornix) from VS Code team.
Happy Coding!

## Why?

Countless hours are spent finding the perfect [JavaScript grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=javascript%20grammar&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance), matching it with a [sleek-looking VS Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Themes&sortBy=Downloads), and experimenting with the [best programming fonts](https://www.slant.co/topics/67/~best-programming-fonts).

Porting over [your theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) takes three days before you can start using VS Code. Then you spend $200 for italic cursive html attributes.

You've spent all that time making the code look perfect.


The code has to look right.

## Seriously, why not just take a screenshot?

- Shadows, padding, and rounded corners are what makes macOSâ€™s screenshots visually appealing. I would love to apply these characteristics to my code snippets too, but macOSâ€™s Grab Tool makes it difficult.
- I want to hide errors, warnings, color decorators, folding markers, line numbers, scrollbar and minimap.
- Windows & Linux users can also benefit from these visually appealing snippets.

## Tip

- If you have the Vim extension, remove its keybinding for copying. Otherwise VS Code won't copy code with syntax highlighting. Alternatively you can run the command `Copy with Syntax Highlighting`.
- When running out of horizontal space, try the command `View: Toggle Editor Group Vertical/Horizontal Layout`.
